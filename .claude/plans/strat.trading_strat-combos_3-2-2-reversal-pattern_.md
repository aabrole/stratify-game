When an [outside bar](https://strat.trading/the-scenarios/scenario-3-in-the-strat-trading/) is followed by a directional bar of the same colour and then an opposite colour directional bar forms, breaking the previous directional bar, a 3-2-2 trend reversal pattern forms in the strat trading. This pattern is a combination of three candlesticks

1. Outside bar
2. Directional bar
3. Directional bar

Based on the trend reversal, this pattern is divided into two types:

- 3-2-2 Bullish Trend Reversal
- 3-2-2 [Bearish Trend Reversal](https://strat.trading/actionable-signals/shooter-and-momo-shooter-pattern/)

I will explain these three [candlestick](https://strat.trading/candlesticks/understanding-candlestick-for-the-strat-trading/) trend reversal patterns in detail in this lesson. I will also elaborate on you with examples so you can easily trade and understand this pattern.

## 3-2-2 Bullish trend Reversal

When a 3 outside bar is followed by a 2D or bearish directional bar, then a 2U or bullish directional bar forms, breaking the high of the previous 2D candlestick, and then a 3-2-2 bullish reversal pattern occurs on the chart. This pattern will turn the previous trend into a bullish one.

To identify this bullish 3-2-2 pattern accurately, you must follow the following rules:

1. First, identify a 3 outside bar or a bearish engulfing pattern. The colour of the inside candle does not matter here.
2. Then, a 2D directional bar will form, making a lower low. It should be in red. It can be a pin bar showing rejection from a support zone.
3. after 2D candlestick, a 2U candlestick will form breaking the high of 2D candlestick.
4. The 2U directional bar should not break below the low of 2D; instead, it should break the high of 2D candlestick.
5. High of 3D candlestick will act as first target level in the strat trading.

![3-2-2 Bullish Reversal](https://strat.trading/wp-content/uploads/3-2-2-Bullish-Reversal-1024x745.png)

Always remember that the formation of highs and lows is more important than the candlestick colours.

## 3-2-2 Bearish Reversal Pattern

When a 3 outside bar is followed by a 2U directional bar and then a 2D bar forms, breaking the low of the previous 2U candlestick, a 3-2-2 bearish reversal pattern forms on the chart. This pattern turns the bullish trend into bearish.

Here are the few steps that a trader must follow to find this pattern accurately:

1. Find a 3 outside bar pattern. It will form at the top of a trend reversal.
2. Then, a 2U candlestick will form, making a higher high. It can also be a pin bar candlestick showing the price rejection from a certain resistance level.
3. After the 2U candlestick, a 2D candlestick will form, breaking the low of the previous 2U candlestick.
4. The 2D candlestick must not break the high of the previous 2U bar; instead, it should break the low, making a lower low.
5. A low of 3 outside bars will act as the first target level for the price.

## The psychology behind the 3-2-2 reversal pattern

In the strat trading, the outside bar pattern is symbol of major trend reversal in the market. Before picking a clear trend, the market always expands its range, aggregating in one direction. So, the outside bar is the alert symbol for a trend reversal in the market.

After the outside bar, a directional bar acts as another high for expansion, but it also acts as a fakeout to eliminate most of the retail traders from the market.

When the price breaks the high/low of the previous directional bar, then it confirms that it has broken the significant barrier or support/resistance level that was on the way to trend reversal. Now, the market is ready to make a major trend reversal.

This is the simple activity of traders behind that chart during the formation of a 3-2-2 reversal pattern.

## Example

Here are the few examples that you can analyse to master the 3-2-2 pattern.

## The bottom line

3-2-2 is the high probability pattern to find a trend reversal. The break of the second candlestick 2 will act as an entry-level, and the high/low of the outside bar will act as the first target level.

If we find this pattern on a daily timeframe, then we can open the intraday timeframes and trade in a bullish direction only from the price break to the target level.

You should backtest this pattern on multiple timeframes and analyze the price patterns.
